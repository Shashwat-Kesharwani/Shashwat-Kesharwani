# 👋 Hi, I'm Shashwat Kesharwani

### 🚀 Full Stack Web Developer (MERN Stack Learner) | HTML • CSS • JavaScript • Node.js • MongoDB

---

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a self-motivated full stack web developer from India who enjoys building interactive, functional, and responsive web applications. I started with Python, moved into front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and now I’m expanding my knowledge into full stack development.

I believe in learning by doing — and that's reflected in the projects I’ve built, such as a **Budget Tracker App** and my **Portfolio Website**. These projects helped me apply both design and development principles in real-world scenarios.
